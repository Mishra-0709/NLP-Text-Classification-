# 📝 Text Classification using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to perform binary text classification using the **20 Newsgroups** dataset, with **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

We classify news articles into two categories:  
- `sci.space`  
- `rec.sport.baseball`  

The pipeline includes:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **20 Newsgroups dataset** provided by `scikit-learn`. It contains thousands of newsgroup documents partitioned into 20 categories.
